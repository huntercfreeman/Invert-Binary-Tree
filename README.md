# Reverse-Binary-Tree

I think I've heard of this as a sort of interview question.

So I want to practice it.

I have to get the entire problem description, it was something like the title though.

I have Visual Studio open.

I'm doing well.

I probably won't say anything beyond this.

But I want everyone to know I'm doing well.
